Cloud service to run on my raspberry pi

### Purpose

I wanted to get started with my raspberry pi, and decided that a cloud-like service would be nice. The idea is to have a web interface to up- and download files.

### Means

I am using PHP7, and MySQL. My testing environment is wampserver. I am not actively using apache, so i'll see if and when I need it


### Copyright

It's on github, what do you expect to find here?
